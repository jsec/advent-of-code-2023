# Advent of Code 

My collection of solutions for Advent of Code puzzles.

Some of them have been cleaned up and optimized. Some are ugly and convoluted. I use these exercises to experiment with algorithms and languages I need to shake the rust off of, or that I haven't gotten to learn yet, so YMMV as to the quality of the solutions.
